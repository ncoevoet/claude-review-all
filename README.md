# /review-all

Project-agnostic code review for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview). One slash command runs deterministic gates, ten parallel review agents, and an adversarial verification pass. Every finding cites `file:line` and is independently re-checked before the report — false positives stay out.

## Severity tiers

- **🔴 CRITICAL** — Breaks functionality, exposes data, crashes systems, violates requirements
- **🟠 IMPORTANT** — Missing error handling, unhandled edge cases, potential bugs
- **🟡 DEBT** — Code duplication, convention violations, refactoring needed within 6 months
- **🔵 SUGGESTED** — Measurable improvements only. If you can't measure the improvement, don't suggest it.
- **⚪ QUESTION** — Items requiring human judgment about requirements or intent

## Install

### Plugin (recommended)

Inside Claude Code, add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add ncoevoet/claude-review-all
/plugin install review-all@ncoevoet
```

`/review-all` is available right away. Update later with `/plugin update review-all@ncoevoet`, remove with `/plugin uninstall review-all@ncoevoet`. CLI equivalents work too: `claude plugin marketplace add ncoevoet/claude-review-all` then `claude plugin install review-all@ncoevoet`. The plugin bundles the skill's `scripts/` and resolves them relative to the skill, so it works wherever Claude Code installs it.

### Manual (`make install`)

For hacking on the skill itself, copy it straight into `~/.claude/skills/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ncoevoet/claude-review-all.git
cd claude-review-all
make install   # copies skills/review-all/ → ~/.claude/skills/review-all/
```

`make uninstall` removes it. `make review-self` installs then reminds you to run `/review-all` in this repo. The skill works in Claude Code only — it depends on filesystem access and bash.

## Use

Inside Claude Code, run `/review-all` with any of these targets:

| Argument | Reviews |
|---|---|
| _(empty)_ | Uncommitted changes if any, else current branch vs default branch, else last commit |
| `--staged` | Only staged changes |
| `--unstaged` | Only unstaged changes |
| `last commit` | `HEAD~1..HEAD` |
| `last N commits` | `HEAD~N..HEAD` |
| `vs <branch>` | Current branch vs merge-base with `<branch>` |
| `<sha1>..<sha2>` | A specific commit range |
| `PR #N` or `#N` | A GitHub PR (requires `gh`) |
| _file paths_ | Restrict review to those files |
| `--paths a/b,c/d` | Filter resolved diff to these path prefixes |
| `--exclude x,y` | Drop these path prefixes from the resolved diff |

Examples:

```
/review-all
/review-all --staged
/review-all PR #123
/review-all last 3 commits
/review-all vs main
/review-all src/auth/login.ts src/auth/session.ts
/review-all PR #42 --exclude apps/legacy
```

## How it works — exact steps

### Phase 0 — Project discovery

| Step | What it does | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 Preflight | Runs `scripts/preflight.sh` to probe `git`/`timeout`/`lsof`/`ss`/`gh`/`jq`/`curl`/`rsync` | One JSON readout lets later phases degrade instead of crashing on a missing tool |
| 0.1 Resolve target | Parses `$ARGUMENTS` against the table above | Single source of truth for "what diff is being reviewed" |
| 0.2 Load config + cache | Reads `.claude/review-all.json`; reuses cached Project Profile if CLAUDE.md hashes match | Avoids re-running detection on hot paths |
| 0.3 + 0.4 Toolchain | `scripts/detect-toolchain.sh` emits `{ecosystem, framework, test, lint, typecheck, build}` | Project-agnostic gate commands; never assumes Angular vs Spring vs Rust |
| 0.5 Project rules | Reads root + nested CLAUDE.md files | "NEVER do X / ALWAYS do Y" steer the agents |
| 0.6 Test patterns | `scripts/test-pattern-probe.sh` infers location, suffix, framework | Spec Existence Check uses this; no hardcoded `__tests__` assumption |
| 0.7 CodeGraph + MCP | Probes the live MCP tool registry; records `toolchain.codegraphTools` keyed by capability | Tool names are not hardcoded — survives MCP-server renames |
| 0.8 Gather diff | Computes diff + per-file slice, applies `--paths`/`--exclude`, recent commit log | Filter is enforced before any agent sees the diff |
| 0.9 Output dirs | Creates `.claude/cache`, `.claude/reports`, `.claude/review-all` | First run on a fresh repo never crashes on a missing dir |

### Phase 1 — Deterministic gates (in parallel)

| Gate | Command | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck | `timeout 120 <discovered>` | Compilers find what review can't |
| Lint | `timeout 120 <discovered>` | Style + simple bugs at zero token cost |
| Tests | `timeout 180 <scoped>` | Smart scoping: tests that import changed files first, fallback to package, fallback to suite |
| Dev-server probe | `scripts/dev-server-probe.sh` | If dev server is up, **skip** the build gate — it's already running |
| Spec existence | per new file vs `toolchain.testPattern` | New public code without tests is automatically 🔴 |
| Dependency check | per manifest diff | New deps / major bumps / removed deps surface explicitly |

Gate-confirmed findings are tagged `VERIFIED` and skip the verification phase. They are real, by definition.

### Phase 1.5 — Runtime probe (optional, self-skipping)

If a UI file changed AND a dev-server port is open AND `curl` exists:

1. Health-check each port (3× with 2s backoff to absorb dev-server warm-up).
2. If Playwright/Puppeteer is installed and a baseline screenshot exists, headless-screenshot the changed routes and pixel-diff against baseline.

Catches dead routes and visual regressions that static review cannot.

### Phase 2 — Parallel agents

Ten specialized agents review the (filtered) diff slice in parallel, each on its own concern:

`standards · bugs+security · DRY · consistency · simplification · security-deep-dive · performance · test-quality · API-contract · a11y/i18n`

Agents share `_shared.md` (severity tiers, 3-question gate, quotas, auto-drop rules, codegraph-tool resolution).

Big diffs are auto-chunked (`chunkMaxFiles=40`, `chunkMaxBytes=200000`) and re-merged by `root_cause_key`.

### Phase 2.5 — Dedupe → adversarial verify

1. **Dedupe** via `scripts/dedupe.py`: groups by `root_cause_key`, annotates `confirmed_by`, applies global caps (SUGGESTED ≤ 10, QUESTION ≤ 8).
2. **Verify** in parallel — one verifier per source agent, spawned at `verifierModel` tier (default Haiku — cheap, fast, JSON-bound). Verifier stance is **hostile**: assume every finding is wrong until disproven.
3. Score: `≥75` → main report, `50–74` → appendix, `<50` → silently dropped.
4. **State sweep** via `scripts/state-sweep.py`: applies `fixed`/`stale`/`snoozed`/`wontfix` transitions to `.claude/review-all/state.json`.

### Phase 2.75 — Completion gate

Every spawned agent and every verifier must have returned with valid JSON, or be explicitly retried once, or be surfaced as `⚠️ PARTIAL REVIEW` in the report. No silent drops.

### Phase 3 — Unified report

Sections, in order: Intent · Summary · Gate Results · 🔴 Critical · 🟠 Important · 🟡 Debt · 🔵 Suggested · ⚪ Questions · Dependency Changes · Appendix.

Heartbeat lines print at each phase boundary so the user sees forward motion on long runs.

### Phase 4 — Post-report menu

Skipped entirely when every section says "None found." Otherwise a two-step menu:

**Primary fix-scope menu** (`AskUserQuestion`, single-select — only scopes with matching findings are shown):

- **Fix critical** (Recommended) — apply 🔴 findings
- **Fix critical + important** — apply 🔴 + 🟠
- **Fix critical + important + debt** — apply 🔴 + 🟠 + 🟡
- **Custom (C/I/D/S + #IDs)** — a free-text expression mixing severity letters and finding IDs/ranges (e.g. `I D #11`, `1-7, 11`)

**Extended follow-up menu** (multi-select, opens after the chosen fix action completes; always includes `Skip / done`): Save full report · Deep-dive a finding · Generate fix patches · Draft commit/PR · Post to GitHub PR · Snooze · Mark wontfix · Schedule re-review · Re-run on fixed code. Compose several in one round.

After a clean apply-fixes (all post-fix gates pass), an **auto-delta** scoped review runs against the just-edited files and appends a `## Post-fix delta` section.

## Pros / Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| **No false positives by design** — every finding survives adversarial re-read | Two-pass model (agents + verifier) costs more tokens than a single-shot review |
| **Project-agnostic** — discovers conventions from the repo, never assumes them | Discovery adds ~3–8s of startup on the first run per repo (cached after) |
| **Filtered scope** — `--paths`/`--exclude` and interactive workspace pruning honor the user's actual focus | The multi-workspace prompt only fires above 50 files / multiple roots — adjust expectations on small repos |
| **Deterministic ops in scripts** — preflight, toolchain, test-pattern, dev-server, dedupe, state-sweep all live in `scripts/`. Reliability + token savings + auditable | Requires bash + Python 3 on the developer machine (default on macOS/Linux; fine in WSL) |
| **Hostile verifier on Haiku** — cheap, fast, no confirmation bias | Verifier mis-scoring on truly novel patterns can hide a real finding in the appendix — escape via `verifierModel: "sonnet"` |
| **Lifecycle-aware** — snoozed/wontfix/stale tracked in `state.json`; recurring findings auto-escalate after 3 sightings | State file is per-repo; not shared across team members. Intentional — comments are the team-wide channel |
| **Plugin-free install** — `make install` and you're done | Not portable to claude.ai uploads or the Claude API runtime (uses git/gh/bash/filesystem). Claude Code only |

## Optional configuration

Drop a `.claude/review-all.json` into any project to tune behavior. All keys optional; documented defaults apply when absent. See `skills/review-all/references/config-keys.md` for the full table with per-key rationales.

Common keys:

```json
{
  "devServerPorts": [4200, 5173, 3000],
  "verifierModel": "haiku",
  "extraAgents": [],
  "skipAgents": []
}
```

### Finding-count caps

Two layers trim a report. Both are config-driven — set the relevant keys to `0` for a complete verified list. 🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 IMPORTANT are never capped at any layer.

| Key | Default | Caps |
|-----|---------|------|
| `quotaDebt` | `5` | 🟡 DEBT findings **per agent** (dropped pre-dedupe) |
| `quotaSuggested` | `3` | 🔵 SUGGESTED findings **per agent** |
| `quotaQuestion` | `2` | ⚪ QUESTION findings **per agent** |
| `suggestedGlobalCap` | `10` | 🔵 SUGGESTED findings **globally**, after dedupe |
| `questionGlobalCap` | `8` | ⚪ QUESTION findings **globally**, after dedupe |

To get every verified finding, zero out both layers for the tier — a per-agent quota drops findings *before* dedupe, so a global cap alone cannot recover them:

```json
{
  "quotaDebt": 0,
  "quotaSuggested": 0,
  "quotaQuestion": 0,
  "suggestedGlobalCap": 0,
  "questionGlobalCap": 0
}
```

`/review-all init` walks an interactive wizard that writes a populated config.

## Optional: CodeGraph

If a CodeGraph MCP server is wired into Claude Code and the project has a `.codegraph/` directory, `/review-all` uses its tools for cross-file analysis (callers, callees, impact). Tool names are resolved at runtime, so any MCP namespace works. Without CodeGraph, the relevant agents fall back to `grep` / `git grep`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
- `git`, `bash`, `python3` (defaults on macOS/Linux)
- `gh` — only for `PR #N` review mode
